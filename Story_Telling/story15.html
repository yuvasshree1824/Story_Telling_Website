            <p>In a royal court, Minister Rajan had served loyally for years. But when a young advisor named Kavin joined the council and impressed the king with his fresh ideas, Rajan grew jealous. Instead of working together, he began plotting ways to discredit Kavin.</p>
            <center> <img src="story14.jpg" height=400 width="700"> </center>
            <p>Rajan spread false rumors and manipulated situations to make Kavin look bad. For a time, it worked. The king began to doubt Kavin. But truth has a way of surfacing. Eventually, Kavin proved his innocence and exposed the ministerâ€™s tricks.</p>
            <p>The king was furious. He dismissed Rajan from his post and promoted Kavin, not just for his intelligence but also for his patience and dignity. Rajan left the court in disgrace, realizing too late how his envy had ruined everything.</p>
            <p>Envy turned a respected minister into a fallen figure. Had Rajan supported instead of competed, both might have served the kingdom well.</p>

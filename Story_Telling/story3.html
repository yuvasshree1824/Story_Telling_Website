            <p>A kind-hearted farmer named Velan noticed a little sparrow struggling to fly in his field. He took it home, fed it water, and let it rest. The sparrow recovered and flew off, chirping happily. The next day, Velan noticed fewer insects damaging his crops.</p>
            <center> <img src="story3.jpg" height=400 width="700"> </center>
            <p>The sparrow had returned—with more birds—clearing pests from the farm every day. Though Velan never asked for help, the sparrow was showing gratitude in its own way. In return, Velan began placing grains near his hut for the birds.</p>
            <p>Seasons passed, and even in drought, the sparrows stayed and helped. Velan's farm remained healthier than others, and people were amazed at his luck. He would simply smile and say, “It's the blessing of remembering kindness.”</p>
            <p>The farmer and the birds shared a quiet bond built on a single act of kindness. In this mutual help, they both thrive teaching that gratitude, even from the smallest creatures, is a noble virtue.</p>

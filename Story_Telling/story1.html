            <p>In the busy town of Kanchipuram, a merchant named Maran owned a successful spice shop. People trusted him for his fresh products and fair prices. But as competition increased, Maran grew greedy. To earn extra profit, he began secretly adjusting his weighing scale, giving customers less than what they paid for.</p>
            <center> <img src="story1.jpg" height=400 width="700"> </center>
            <p>At first, no one noticed the trick. But one day, an old woman compared her purchase and found it short. She told her neighbors, and soon the news spread. People felt betrayed and stopped buying from Maran. His business declined sharply, and even his regular customers walked away.</p>
            <p>Left with an empty shop and a heavy heart, Maran began to reflect. He remembered the Thirukkural his father had taught him as a childâ€”about the value of honesty. Ashamed of his actions, he publicly apologized and started giving exact weights, even offering extra to win back trust.</p>
            <p>Slowly, people returned, appreciating his sincerity. Maran<q></q>s shop regained its good name, not just for spices, but for integrity. He realized that short-term gains from dishonesty cost more than they give.</p>

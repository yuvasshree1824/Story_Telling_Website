            <p>In a large kingdom, there lived a wise and just king named Arivan. One day, while walking in disguise among his people, a poor man insulted him out of frustration, unaware of the king’s true identity. The king’s guards were furious and drew their swords, demanding immediate punishment.

            <p>But King Arivan raised his hand calmly and stopped them. “Let him speak. He is angry, not evil,” he said. Days later, the poor man realized whom he had insulted and came forward trembling with fear, begging for forgiveness.</p>
            <p>To his surprise, the king smiled and forgave him, saying, “Anger is momentary, but kindness leaves a mark forever.” The man was deeply moved by the king’s patience and went on to become one of his most loyal subjects.</p>
            <p>
King Arivan’s calmness turned an enemy into a friend, and the people admired him even more. His patience taught the kingdom that true strength lies not in punishment, but in understanding.</p>

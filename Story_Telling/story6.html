            <p><b>Kural: </b> <span> <q><b>The wealth of a mother is her son’s good conduct. (Kural 70)</b></q></span></p>
    
            <p>In a quiet hamlet, a mother named Meenakshi raised her son, Arun, with great care. From a young age, she taught him honesty, respect for elders, and compassion for all. Whenever he did wrong, she corrected him with patience, not punishment.</p>
            <center> <img src="story6.jpg" height=400 width="700"> </center>
            <p>When Arun grew older, his classmates began stealing fruits from a neighbor’s farm. They asked him to join, but he refused. “My mother taught me better,” he said firmly. Though mocked, Arun stood by his values.</p>
            <p>Years later, Arun became a respected judge known for his fairness and honesty. At every award ceremony, he thanked his mother, saying, “She shaped who I am.”</p>
            <p>Meenakshi never had riches, but she raised a son who became the pride of the town. Her true wealth was her son’s character—a lesson every parent remembered.</p>

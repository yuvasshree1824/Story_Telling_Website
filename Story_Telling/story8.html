            <p><b>Kural: </b> <span> <q><b>Among the learned, silence is the best speech. (Kural 299)</b></q></span></p>
    
            <p>In a small village nestled between hills lived a sage named Yogi, known for his silence. People often visited him with problems, expecting advice. But Yogi rarely spoke. He would listen calmly, nod, and offer only a few quiet words—if any at all.</p>
            <center> <img src="story8.jpg" height=400 width="700"> </center>
            <p>Some villagers mocked him, saying, “What use is a wise man who doesn’t speak?” But others noticed that just by sitting with him, their hearts felt lighter, and their minds clearer. Over time, disputes in the village began to reduce, as people learned to listen more and talk less.</p>
            <p>One day, two men came fighting over land. Yogi offered them a seat and let them talk. After a long silence from the sage, the men paused and looked at each other. Without a word from Yogi, they realized their mistake and agreed to share the land peacefully.</p>
            <p>Yogi’s quiet nature taught them that wisdom often lies not in loud words, but in peaceful stillness. Silence, when practiced with understanding, becomes the strongest voice.</p>

            <p>A farmer named Dhanam lived peacefully with his family. One night, a thief entered his farm to steal vegetables. But instead of calling the police, Dhanam invited the man in and gave him food. “You must be desperate,” he said gently.</p>
            <center> <img src="story11.jpg" height=400 width="700"> </center>
            <p>The thief was shocked. No one had ever treated him with such kindness. Ashamed, he confessed that hunger had driven him to crime. Dhanam offered him work on the farm, saying, “If you’re honest, you can start again.”</p>
            <p>Grateful for the second chance, the man began working sincerely. Over time, he earned Dhanam’s trust and the respect of the villagers. He became a changed man—hardworking, honest, and grateful.</p>
            <p>Dhanam’s simple act of forgiveness transformed a thief into a friend. He proved that kindness could reach where punishment could not.</p>
